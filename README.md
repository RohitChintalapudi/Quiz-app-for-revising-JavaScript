# Quiz-app-for-revising-JavaScript
A simple yet feature-rich product management/cart app built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built this project to revise all JavaScript concepts in one go â€” from DOM manipulation and event handling to dynamic updates and responsive design. It serves as my personal "revision checkpoint" for core web development skills.
