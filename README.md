# Product Management App (JavaScript Revision Project)

This is a simple **Product Management / Cart App** built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
I created this project **just to revise everything I've learned so far in JavaScript** — applying concepts, experimenting with dynamic DOM updates, and reinforcing old knowledge in a practical way.
