# Quiz App (JavaScript Revision Project)

This is a simple yet interactive **Quiz App** built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
I developed this project to **revise and apply all the JavaScript concepts I’ve learned** — covering DOM manipulation, event listeners, dynamic updates, and conditional logic, while also refreshing my knowledge of responsive CSS design.
